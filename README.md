# Link Opener

Alfred Workflow to quickly open routine links by a common name.

Why this workflow?  Why not use bookmarks?  Well - sometimes you need to open a link using a name that you know and it's easily served up via other means.  Link Opener allows you to call up these links quickly.

## Requirements

* Perl 5

## Usage

Bring up Alfred and type `link` and then any part of the link 'name'.

Results will be sorted first by 'popularity' (how many times you've used it), then alphabetically.

### Add links

Bring up Alfred and type `link add` followed by the link and (optionally) a name that can be used to find the link.  If no 'name' is provided then the last part of the URL is used.
